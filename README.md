# ZERO-TO-HERO-NESTJS

## NestJS  Modules 

+ Each application has at least one module - the root module. That is the starting point of the application.
+ Modules are an effective way to organzie components by a closely related set of capabilities (e.g. per feature).
+ It is a good practice to have a folder per module containing the module's components l
+  Modules are **singletons,** therefore a module can be inported by multiple other modules.

## Defining a module

A module is defined by annotating a class with the **@Module** decorator
The decorator provides metadata that Nest uses to organize the application structure.

## @Module Decorator Properties
+ **providers:**  Array of providers to be available within the module via dependency injection
+ **controllers:**  Array of controllers to be instantiated within the module.
+ **exports:**  Array of controllers to export to other modules.
+ **imports:**  List of modules required by this modules. Any exported provider by these modules will now be available in our module via dependency injection.

## Module Definition Example

```bash
@Module({
  providers: [ForumService],
  controllers: [ForumController],
  imports: [
      PostModule,
      CommentModule,
      AuthModule,
   ],
   exports: [ForumService]
 })
 
 export class ForumModule {}
    
```

## NestJS Controllers

+ Responsible for handling incoming **requests** and returning **responses** to the client.
+ Bound to a specific **path** (for example, "/tasks" for the task resource) .
+ Contain **handlers** which handle **endpoints** and **request methods** (GET, POST, DELETE etcetera).
+ can take advantage of **dependency injection** to consume providers within the same module.

## Defining a Controller 

+ Controllers are defined by decorating a class with the **@Controller** decorator.
+ The decorator accepts a string , which is the **path** to be handled by the controller.

```bash
@Controller('/tasks')
export class TasksController {
   //....
}
    
```

## Defining a Handler

Handlers are simply methods within the controller class, decorated with decorators such as **@Get, @Post, @Delete** etcetera.

```bash
@Controller('/tasks')
export class TasksController {
   @Get()
   getAllTasks() {
        # //do stuff
        return ...;
   }
   
   @Post()
   createTask() {
      # // do stuff
      return ...;
   }
}

```

## NestJS Providers

+ Can be injected into constructors if decorated as an **@Injectable** , via **dependency injection** .
+ Can be a plain value , a class, sync/async factory etc.
+ Providers must be provided to a module for them to be usable.
+ Can be exported from a module - and then be available to other modules that import it .


## What is a service ?

+ Defined as providers . **Not All providers are services.**
+ Common concept within software development and are not exclusive NestJS, JavaScript or back-end development .
+ Singleton when wrapped with **@Injectable()** and provided to a module. That means , the same instance will be shared across the application - acting as a single source of truth.
+ The main source of business logic. For example, a service will be called from a controller to validate data, create an item in the database and return a response .

### Providers in Modules

```bash
import {TasksControllers } from './tasks.controller';
import { TasksService } from './tasks.service' ;
import { LoggerService } from '../shared/logger.service' ;

@Module({
  controllers: [
    TasksControllers
  ],
  providers: [
    TasksService,
    LoggerService,
  ]
  
})
export class TaskModules

```

## Dependency Injection in NestJS
+ Any component within the NestJS ecosystem can inject a provider that is decorated with the **@Injectable** .
+ We define the dependencies in the constructor of the class . NestJS will take care of the injection for us, and it will then be available as a class property .

```bash
import { TasksService } from './tasks.service' ;

@Controller('/tasks')
export class TasksController {
  constructor (private tasksService: TasksService) {}
   
   @Get()
  async getAllTasks() {
      return await this.tasksService.getAllTasks();
  }
}

```

## Data Transfer Object (DTO)

+ Common concept in software development that is not specific to NestJS.
+ Result in more bulletproof code, as it can be used as a TypeScript Type .
+ Do not have any behavior except for storage, retrieval, serialization and deserilization of its own data.
+ Result in increased performance (allthough negligible in small applications ).
+ Can be useful for data validation.
+ A DTO is **NOT** a model definition . It defines the shape of data for a specific case , for example - creating a task . 
+ Can be defined using and **interface** or a **class** .


## Classes VS Interfaces for DTOs

+ Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) can be defined as classes or interfaces .
+ The recommended approach is to use **classes**, also clearly documented in the NestJS documentation.
+ The reason in that interfaces are a part of TypeScript and therefore are not preserved post-commilation.
+ NestJS cannot refer to interfaces in run-time, but can refer to classes.
**TLDR: Classes are the way to go for DTOs.**

## NestJS Pipes

+ Pipes operate on the **arguments** to be processed by the route handler, just before the handler is called.
+ Pipes can perform **data transformation ** or **data validation** .
+ Pipes can return data - either original or modified - which will be passed on to the router handler.
+ Pipes can throw exceptions. Exceptions thrown will be handled by NestJS and parsed into an error response.
+ Pipes can be asynchronous.


## Default Pipes in NestJS

NestJs ships with useful pipes within the **@nestjs/common module** .


## ValidationPipes
Validates the compatibility of an ertire object against a class ( goes well with DTOs , or Data Transfer Objects ) . If any property cannot be mapped properly ( For example , mimatching type )  validation will fail. 
A Very common use case , therefore having a built-in validation pipe is extremly useful

## PareseIntPipes 
By default, arguments are of type **string** . This pipe validates that an argument is a number, If successful, the argument is transformed into a **Number** and passed on to the handler .


## Custom Pipe Implementation 

+ Pipes are classes annotated with the **@Injectable()** decorator.
+ Pipes must implement the **PipeTransform** generic interface . Therefore, every pipe must have a **transform()** method . This method will be called by NestJS to process the arguments. 
+ The **transform()** method accepts two parameters:
    **value :** the value of the processed argument.
    **metadata** (optional) : an object containing metadata about the argument.
+ Whatever is returned from the **transform()** method will be passed on to the route handler . Exceptions will be sent back to the client. 
+ Pipes can be consumed in different ways .

**Handler-level pipes** are defined at the handler level, via the **@UsePipes()** decorator. Such pipe will process all parameters for the incoming requests.

```bash
@Post()
@UsePipes(SomePipes)
createTask(
  @Body("description") description
 ) {
        ///...
 }

```


**Parameter-level pipes** are defined at the parameter level. Only the specific parameter for which the pipe has been specified will be processed.

```bash
@Post()
createTask(
  @Body("description", SomePipe) description
 ) {
        ///...
 }

```

**Global pipes** are defined at the application level and will be applied to any incoming request.

```bash
async funtion bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
  app.useGlobalPipes(SomePipe);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();

```

**Parameter -level VS Handler-level pipes . which one ?**

  + **Parameter-level pipes** tend to be slimmer and cleaner. However , they often result in extra code added to handlers - this can get messy and hard to maintain.
  + **Handler-level pipes** require some more code, but provide some great benifits: 
          + such pipes do not require extra code at the parameter level.
          + Easier to maintain and expand .If the shape of the data change, it is easy to make the necessary changes within the pipe only.
          + Responsibility of identifying the arguments to process is shifed to one central file - the pipe file
          + Promote usage of DTOs ( Data Transfer Objects ) which is a very good practice.
